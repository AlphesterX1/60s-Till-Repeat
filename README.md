# 60s Till Repeat

> **"Dying is the only way to live."**

**60s Till Repeat** is an isometric puzzle-adventure where traditional gaming logic is flipped on its head: **damage is progress.** In this world, the hazards you usually avoid are your greatest assets, and the "help" you find is your greatest hindrance.

## 🎮 The Concept

In most games, health is a resource to be protected. Here, it is a burden. To navigate the world and overcome its challenges, you must strategically damage yourself to shed weight and gain the momentum required to survive.

### Core Mechanics
* **Pain is Power:** Strategic collisions with spikes, enemies, and lasers grant you the speed necessary to clear massive gaps or beat tight countdowns.
* **The Weight of Health:** Healing items are traps. Restoring your health adds "weight" to your character, stripping away your speed and leaving you sluggish.
* **Health Saver:** You Use your health bar as sword, so when you hit the enemies your health bar reduces
* **Isometric Puzzles:** Navigate complex environments that require precise timing and a calculated approach to self-sacrifice.
